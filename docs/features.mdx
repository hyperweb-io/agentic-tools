# Supercharge Your Interchain Development with Hyperweb Agentic Tools

Unlock new efficiency and power in your Cosmos and interchain projects with our suite of Model Context Protocol (MCP) enabled tools. Designed to integrate with AI agents like Cursor and Claude Desktop, these tools will enhance your development workflow.

## Why Use Our Agentic Tools?

- üß© **Simplify Complexity:** Streamline common development tasks within the interchain ecosystem.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Development:** Leverage your AI coding assistant for faster, more intuitive, and less error-prone development.
- üîå **Seamless Integration:** Connect our tools with your existing projects and preferred AI development environment.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Comprehensive Toolkit:** From managing chain information and UIs to launching testnets, we offer support for key areas like Chain Registry, Interchain Kit, InterchainJS, and Starship.
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Effortless Migrations:** Smoothly transition from older libraries (CosmosKit, CosmJS) with guided, AI-assisted processes.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Automated Configuration:** Generate Starship configurations with ease, letting you focus on building.
- üåê **Standardized & Reliable:** Employ a consistent set of tools across your interchain projects.
- üìÑ **Reduced Boilerplate:** Get up and running quickly with readily available examples and usage patterns.

## Key Features

Our MCP server, easily runnable with `npx -y @hyperweb/mcp-server@latest`, provides a range of tools to assist with development in the Hyperweb and Cosmos ecosystems. Key functionalities include:

- **Chain Registry (`useChainRegistry`)**

  - Access version-specific (v1, v2) usage patterns and implementation examples for the Chain Registry.
  - Facilitates programmatic interaction with chain metadata, asset lists, and IBC data.

- **Interchain Kit (`useInterchainKit`, `migrateFromCosmosKitToInterchainKit`)**

  - Generate framework-specific (React, Vue) examples for integrating Interchain Kit, a library for interchain wallet connections.
  - Provides a migration tool to assist in transitioning projects from CosmosKit to Interchain Kit, streamlining the upgrade process.
  - Simplifies wallet connections, transaction signing, and state management for decentralized applications.

- **InterchainJS (`useInterchainjs`, `migrateToInterchainjs`)**

  - Offers comprehensive usage examples for the InterchainJS library, a powerful tool for client-side interactions with Cosmos SDK chains.
  - Includes a migration utility to convert CosmJS codebases to InterchainJS, complete with package manager awareness (npm, yarn, pnpm) for dependency management.
  - Enables robust transaction building, querying, and interaction with chain modules.

- **Starship (`setupStarship`, `generateStarshipConfig`, `verifyStarshipConfig`)**
  - Provides guidance on setting up Starship, a unified development and testing environment for Cosmos chains.
  - Features a powerful configuration helper (`generateStarshipConfig`) that provides comprehensive documentation and type definitions to assist in creating detailed `config.yaml` files.
  - Includes a validation tool (`verifyStarshipConfig`) to parse and check Starship YAML configurations against the official schema, ensuring correctness before deployment.
